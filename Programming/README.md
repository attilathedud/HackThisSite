### Problem 1 (Word Unscrambler)
This is a relatively easy challenge due to Python's ability to easily read and parse files. We simply read in our wordlist and then iterate through sorting each word and assigning it to a new list. Since we know the append operation is synchronise, we can safely assume the index of both lists are identical. From there, we simply sort our arguments and find them in the sorted list and return the word from the unsorted list by index.
